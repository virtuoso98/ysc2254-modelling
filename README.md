# Modelling and Optimization

This course was taken in Year 2, Semester 2 of college. This course was sort of an Applied Mathematics course where we learnt how to formulate problems with given constraints and use certain methods to optimize them. Concepts that I've picked up include

 * Linear Programming - Simplex Algorithm, Integer Programming, Branch-and-bound
 * Network flow - Dijkstra's Algorithm, Minimum Spanning Trees
 * Nonlinear Programming - Kuhn-Tucker conditions, Lagrange Multiplier, Hessian
 * Probabilistic Optimization - Decision Trees, Markov Chains

Below shows some the projects I did for my midterm and finals. If you're interested, do get into my repository and look at the attached pdf of my report :smiley:

## :books: Midterm Project - Optimizing Student life

In my midterm project, I tried to optimize my student life by self-formulating a utility function consisting of the amount of time spent on sleep, work, commitments, meals and leisure. I mainly explored the **Simplex Algorithm** Using the **PuLP** library from python. 

## :snake: Term Project - Snakes And Ladders

In one of my term projects, I revisited a old childhood game I used to play, which is snakes and ladders. During then, I used to naively roll the dice and hope that I'd land on the ladder (or at least, not the head of a snake). I modelled the game using **Markov Chains** in R (which is totally possible)! I used this to try and analyse the game in a less random but structured manner and discovered some interesting things in the process!

## :hammer_and_pick: Term Project - Optimizing Working Life

In my other term project, I revisited my midterm project on optimizing student life, except that it is now about working life. Coding this using R, I tried to re-formulate the problem in the context of work. I felt that this was needed because there were some non-linear constraints that I wanted to formulate in my midterm project but could not do so due to my limited knowledge. Interestingly, my function could not converge :laughing:
